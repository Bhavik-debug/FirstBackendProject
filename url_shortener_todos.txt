Project To-Dos (URL Shortener Service)

Goal:
Design a URL shortener service that:
- Takes a valid URL
- Returns a shortened URL
- Redirects users to the original URL
- Tracks total visits/clicks on each shortened URL

Routes:
POST /url - Generates a new short URL and returns it in the format example.com/random-id
GET /:id - Redirects the user to the original URL
GET /url/analytics/:id - Returns the number of clicks/visits for the provided short id
